# hello-world
My name is Darren Tran.

Currently I am a biomedical engineering student at the University of South Florida going into my fourth year. My plan is to transition to into the more computer engineering side of BME that focuses on integrating hardware and software. I have found that I have a passion for robotics, specifically the inner workings of human-robot interactions. Programming has been challenging and fun for me so far, I can't wait to see what is in store for me.
